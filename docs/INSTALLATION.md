The packaging process depends on the following to external programs:

* fpm: see https://github.com/jordansissel/fpm
* rsync: this is usually installed on most \*nix like systems

These two programs need to be installed before you can use the packaging
scripts.

Build Server / Workstation
==========================

You need a machine to build your packages. This could be your local development machine, or you can also set up a build server with all tools installed to avoid everybody installing individually. (@liipers: look in our wiki for build.liip.ch)
