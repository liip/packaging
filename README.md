General Informations about Packaging
====================================
A Package is basically the sources of a project you wan't to have on a live system, install scripts plus meta data.
Linux Distributions (Feodora, Redhat etc.) usually have a .rpm package manager. Debian and Ubuntu are using .deb packages
So depending on your deployment Server, you need different prerequisites. Check the INSTALLATION.md for more information.
